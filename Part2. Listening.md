Part 2, Listening (five questions, two marks each): I will play five short musical passages. For one 
mark,  you  will  identify  the  work  and,  where  possible,  the  composer.  For  a  second  mark,  you  will 
briefly  answer  a  factual  question,  such  as  “what  type  of  texture  do  we  hear  in  this  passage?”  or 
“which specific component of opera seria is this?” (eg., aria, secco recitative, chorus, overture).
